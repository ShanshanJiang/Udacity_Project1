## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.\*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the Seattle Airbnb Data from 2016provided by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?datasetId=393) to better understand:

1. Is there any peak season for Airbnb in Seattle?
2. Is the Airbnb in Seattle occupied by some host with many listings, or it's more like small business?
3. Is the type of house impacting the price and popularity?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- Seattle_Airbnb_Data (folder)

  - This contains the source files for this project. The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:
    - Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
    - Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
    - Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

- Project_1_Seattle (Jupyter Source File)
  - This is the Jupyter notebook conducts all the analysis
